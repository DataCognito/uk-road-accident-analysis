# UK Road Accident Analysis Dashboard

This project analyzes road accident data in the UK for 2021 and 2022 to provide insights into accident trends, severity, and contributing factors. The analysis was performed using Microsoft Excel, and the findings are presented in an interactive dashboard.

## Project Requirements

The goal of this project was to create a road accident dashboard that allows users to

 Primary KPIs
     Analyze total casualties resulting from accidents.
     Understand the distribution of casualties by accident severity.
     Identify the vehicle types involved in the highest number of casualties.
 Secondary KPIs
     Analyze total casualties by vehicle type.
     Compare monthly casualty trends between the current and previous year.
     Identify the road types with the highest number of casualties.
     Analyze the distribution of casualties by road surface.
     Explore the relationship between casualties by arealocation and daynight.

## Dataset

This project analyzes UK road accident data from 2021 and 2022. The dataset contains over 300,000+ records, each with details like

 Accident date and time
 Location
 Severity (fatal, serious, slight)
 Casualties and vehicles involved
 Road and environmental conditions

This data allows for a comprehensive analysis of accident trends and contributing factors.

## Analysis and Visualizations

The analysis was conducted using Microsoft Excel, leveraging its features like pivot tables, charts, and slicers to explore and visualize the data. The key findings are presented in an interactive dashboard and an analysis report.

### Dashboard

This dashboard provides an overview of the key performance indicators (KPIs) related to road accidents in the UK. It allows users to filter the data by year and urbanrural location and explore various visualizations, including

 Total casualties and their breakdown by severity.
 Casualties by vehicle type, road type, and road surface.
 Monthly trends of casualties for 2021 and 2022.
 Distribution of casualties by area and light conditions.

### Analysis Report

The analysis report provides a more detailed view of the data, including

 Monthly trends for 2021 and 2022, showing the total number of casualties for each month.
 Breakdown of casualties by area (urbanrural), light conditions (daynight), road surface, vehicle type, road type, and severity.

Additional visualizations can be found in the [Visualization](Visualization/) folder.

## Key Findings

Overall Casualty Trend The total number of casualties in 2021 was 222,145 representing a slight decrease compared to 2021. This trend can be observed in the line chart on the dashboard.

Seasonal Variations Casualties tend to be higher in the summer months (June-August) and lower in the winter months (December-February), as shown in the monthly trend tables in the analysis report. This could be due to factors like increased travel and outdoor activities during the summer.

Severity Distribution The majority of casualties (around 80%) were classified as Slight, indicating that most accidents result in minor injuries. However, serious and fatal casualties still accounted for a significant portion, with around 17% and 3% respectively. This distribution is clearly visible in the pie chart on the dashboard.

Vehicle Type and Casualties Cars were involved in the highest number of casualties, highlighting the importance of road safety measures for car drivers and passengers. Pedestrians and motorcycles also accounted for a significant portion of casualties, suggesting the need for targeted safety interventions for these vulnerable road users. This breakdown can be seen in the bar chart titled Total Casualties by Vehicle Type on the dashboard.

Road Type and Risk Single carriageways were the most common location for accidents, likely due to their higher prevalence and traffic volume. In fact, over 165k casualties occurred on single carriageways in 2021. Interestingly, roundabouts had a relatively low number of casualties compared to other road types, possibly due to their design features that promote slower speeds and controlled traffic flow. This comparison is evident in the Casualties by Road Type table in the analysis report.

Road Surface Conditions While most casualties occurred on dry roads, wetdamp road conditions also contributed significantly, emphasizing the importance of safe driving practices in all weather conditions. This relationship is shown in the Casualties by Road Surface table in the analysis report.

Urban vs. Rural and DayNightUrban areas experienced a significantly higher number of casualties compared to rural areas, with over 130k+ casualties occurring in urban areas in 2021. This is likely due to higher population density and traffic congestion in urban areas. The majority of casualties occurred during daylight hours, which could be attributed to increased traffic volume and activity during the day. These patterns can be observed in the donut charts on the dashboard.
